3. Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issuesâ€™
4. Includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability and automatically recovering from failure

### Performance efficiency

- The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve

### Cost optimization

- The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

### Sustainability

- The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing effciency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required
